# Sheikh-1.5: XML MDX System Prompt Framework

*The Complete AI Development Ecosystem Documentation*

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

Sheikh AI Suite represents the next evolution in AI-native development, providing a comprehensive ecosystem that treats artificial intelligence as a first-class engineering discipline. This document outlines the complete technical blueprint, implementation strategy, and architectural vision for the most advanced AI development platform ever created.

### Core Philosophy

**"Prompts are code. Engineer them accordingly."**

This principle transforms prompt engineering from an art to a structured engineering discipline with modularity, type safety, composability, and testability at its core.

## üèóÔ∏è Three Pillars Architecture

### 1. The Core: Sheikh API
**High-performance language models with framework-aware intelligence**

- **Production-Ready Performance**: Sub-second response times with 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Framework-Aware Intelligence**: Deep understanding of React, TypeScript, Node.js, and modern web architectures
- **Advanced Reasoning**: Multi-step problem solving with contextual memory
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Auto-scaling API infrastructure handling millions of requests

**Available Models:**
- `sheikh-1.5-lg`: 128k context, 8k max output - Advanced reasoning and code generation
- `sheikh-1.5-md`: 64k context, 4k max output - Balanced performance for production workloads
- `sheikh-embed-v1`: 1536-dimension embeddings for semantic search

### 2. The Bridge: @ai-sdk-likhon/sheikh
**TypeScript-first SDK for seamless integration**

```typescript
import { sheikh } from '@ai-sdk-likhon/sheikh';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

// One-line integration with full type safety
const result = await streamText({
  model: sheikh('sheikh-1.5-lg', {
    apiKey: process.env.SHEIKH_API_KEY,
    maxTokens: 2048,
    temperature: 0.7
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a TypeScript interface for user authentication'
});
